            The World Wide Web or the Web consist of computers that use the Internet to communicate with one another. The basics of the Web include a computer with a browser installed, the Internet, servers and HTTP. HTTP is the main protocol of the web, the Internet can be consider the highway that connects the computers together. the servers are computer that are design to store an distribute information. </p>

           Files found on the World Wide Web can be any of the following types:

            <p>Hypertext Markup Language, HTML for Short, which makes up most of the content on the web. HTML is made up of text, symbols and code that tells the browser how to display the page Content is what you see Markup...What it looks like referenced
              to other documents.....Images and Videos Links ....To other pages There was discussion in the makeup of an HTML Documents including the contents in the header using the tag head as well as makeup of the body of the document using the tag

            <p>The old adage of garbage in equals' garbage out (GIGO) holds especially true when working with computers. Writing HTML Documents requires the inputter to speak the HTML language (and some others). Failure to properly speak to the computer
              will result in much frustration and long days; I have rediscovered this this past week.

          <h2>Object Orientated Programming</h2>
          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>Object Orientated Programming (OOP) is a methodology to software development that ensures programmers go through an extensive planning process. This planning process leads to better designs and reduces the time need to troubleshoot coding issues. OOP may be considered a collection of interacting objects; each object is capable of sending and receiving messages and processing data.

          <h2>Object</h2>
          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are instantiation of a class. Objects are manipulated and developed to refine the end product. Take the class of car, the class Car() defines the basics or the base of a car. Tires, engine, body, number of doors, etcetera. So when you instantiate the class Car() you’ve created an object that can now be developed and refined by designing a specific car. ie. A car with a large V8 or one small fuel efficient 4 cylinder; each could be designed as separate objects from class Car()

          <h2>Class</h2>
          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>A class is a folder that contains information that can be referred to as needed to replicate some routine. It provides access to material. Like a library it is an organized collection of sources of information, made accessible to a a program for reference or borrowing. Class is like a programmable calculator where formulas are pre-stored, the user refers to the formulas when entering new math problems.

          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>An object that is created from a class is said to be an instance of the class. iI the senario class Car() we create two objects , my.car  and your.car this is two instance of class Car().

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>Actions we take to modify a object is called Methods, method works in the same way as a simple function. However, a method's first argument always receives the instance object. So in our inheritance code the method (see Below) points to Parent() Instance.

          <h2>Module</h2>
          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>Modular programing is a software style where you break your program into workable segments or modules. This concept allows for the development of reliable, readable and maintainable programs with little or no dependences with other modules.  It appears to be a more liner approach to programing. Modules in Python contain definitions and statements, and can be imported much like classes. A Module is a file that serves as a structural unit of python code. Modules allow for segmentation of large amounts of code into manageable modules allowing developers to proof modules individually instead of one massive program. For instance Python has a module called webbrowser which can be imported in to Python to assist with web applications. The ability to import modules for python aids the developer in quickly completing projects by using code that has been pre-written and tested.

            <p>The defition of labrary is a place to store collections, these collections normally consist of  music, books, magazine and films. Library articles are not normally sold but rather loaned or barrowed. The Python library is not much different except that all of the material stored is intended to be usefull to a developer buy providing information or programing code to developers using the Python programming language.

          <h2>Abstraction</h2>
          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>Commonly referred to as data hiding abstraction, when discussing object-oriented programming, refers to the ability to use complex programing code and ideas by referring to them. This allows the programmer to more quickly and efficiently write code by referring to code that he has either already written or has access to. Abstraction allows the programmer to use only the basic information need for his project. Take the example class Car() when a developer creates an object my.car from class Car()he is looking for a starting point. He will get the basic car unit and not a $200,000.00 race car. In the case of the base car model it gives the developer a clean starting point without having to go in and rework the race car before he can develop his own car.

          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>Class variables are shared in the sense that they are accessed by all objects of that class. There is only one copy of the class variable and when any one object makes a change to a class variable, the change is reflected in all the other instances as well. There are pre-defined Class vriables such as instantiation operation, _ _init_ _, or user defined ones such as the one used in class VALID RATINGS.

          <h2>Inheritance</h2>
          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>Inheritance is when a class object inherits information or definitions from another class; this allows the programmer to reuse code, saving time and resources. This is feature is a great advantage of object-orientated programming. An example: I have a BBQ smoker where I smoke pork ribs and/or pulled pork both receipts use the same spice rub. I inherited the pulled pork rub from the ribs. I only need the rub receipt once, I can use it over and over.

          <h2>OOP CSS and HTML</h2>
          <div class="Concept-Description">
            <p>Even though I’ve only had these few weeks in programming, it would appear to me that if some of the goals for OOP include reusing code, readability, and maintenance. One look at CSS or HTML would immediately see that both of these codes could benefit from OOP. Like using OOP principles in Python, using OOP principles with CSS (and HTML) takes much more up front planning, that planning leads to fewer lines of that are repeated in CSS this will lead to smaller size files causing faster transferring of that code.</p>
            <p>Looking at the 89 lines of CSS code submitted for this project it becomes quite apparent that with some preplanning (and training on my part) the number of lines of written code could have been greatly reduced. Some examples of repeated lines include:</p>
            <div class="Concept-code">
              <ul>
               <li> Font Family: Veranda   five times</li>
              <li>Border-Radius: 10px three times </li>
              <li>Border-Radius: 20px three times</li></div>
            </ul>
             <p> It doesn’t take long to comprehend that preplanning along with OOP will reduce the lines of code on even the simplest projects. Preplanning may include normalizing code like border radius to one standard size, if possible.
              I’ve read some articles on this topic, some web sites listed below, I have to say as an infant in programming the conventional style sheet and HTML seem much easier to read and troubleshoot. Of course if I were writing vast amounts of code my opinion could very well change.
